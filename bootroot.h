 * Link to /usr/local/lib/libBootRoot.a via -lBootRoot
 *
 * libBootRoot generally requires clients to link against:
 *  ApplicationServices.framework -> -framework ApplicationServices
 *  CoreFoundation.framework -> -framework CoreFoundation
 *  DiskArbitration.framework -> -framework DiskArbitration
 *  IOKit.framework -> -framework IOKit
 *  /usr/local/lib/libbless.a -> add -lbless
 * only available on 10.7 (see below for 10.6):
 *  /usr/lib/libCoreStorage.dylib -> -lCoreStorage
 *  /usr/lib/libcsfde.dylib -> -lcsfde
 *  EFILogin.framework -> -framework EFILogin
 *
 * The use of dead code stripping is strongly recommended to
 * reduce the number of libraries required.
 *
 * The 10.7 libraries can be weak-linked if clients need to run
 * on 10.6:
 * Set the "Base SDK" to "Current Mac OS", and set the deployment
 * target to "Mac OS X 10.6".  10.7-only functions should fail
 * cleanly if inadvertently called on 10.6 (see caveats at 10831618
 * and related).
 *
 * Several clients
 * 1. basic "kextcache -u" (Installer, kextd, etc)
 * 2a. "set up Boot!=Root in an Apple_Boot" (Disk Management for CSFDE)
 * 2b. "deactivate Boot!=Root in an Apple_Boot" (Disk Management post-CSFDE)
 * 3a. "custom configure an Apple_Boot to boot off some other volume" (IA)
 * 3b. "keep system Boot!=Root out of the way" (Install Assistant)
 * 4a. set up booting within a directory in an Apple_Boot (Time Machine)
 * 4b. set up booting with a temporary directory (ANI5)
 *
 * WARNING: libBootRoot is NOT THREAD-SAFE / re-entrant.  It uses
 * basename(3), dirname(3), relies on internal static storage, and
 * uses global fchdir() to keep from straying from the target fsys.
 * Complex multi-threaded programs should probably create a 'brtool'
 * and call that as a separate process until 10561671 is addressed.

 *  @discussion
 *      BRCopyBootFiles() copies appropriate boot cache files from a 
 *      source volume to a single target partition.  BRCopyBootFiles()
 *      updates any out of date caches before copying them to the target.
 *
 *      The partition referred to by helperBSDName:
 *          - must contain a valid HFS+ filesystem
 *          - should not "belong" to any root volume except initialRoot
 *          - for FDE, must follow initialRoot's Apple_CoreStorage
 *      It will be treated as a helper partition: mounted as
 *      necessary and soft-unmounted regardless of success.
 *
 *      Once complete, the helper's filesystem will be blessed such
 *      that the option-boot picker will show srcVol's label.  If NVRAM
 *      needs to point to the partition before normal invocations of
 *      bless(8) would correctly set it, libbless's BLSetEFIBootDevice()
 *      can be used to point NVRAM at the helper partition.
 *
 *      Note: srcVol cache updates are made with the running system's
 *      kext subsystem.  Behavior is be undefined if a statically-
 *      linked BRCopyBootFiles() is called on an older system when
 *      srcVol's caches are out of date and the older system can't
 *      properly update them.
 *      
 *      If [Boot!=Root has not been disabled and] srcVol and initialRoot
 *      refer to the same volume, its "boot stamps" will be updated to
 *      assure the system's Boot!=Root that everything is "up to date." 
 *
 *      BR*Update*BootFiles() can be used on a volume with the force
 *      argument to get all currently-active helper partition(s) back
 *      in sync with their root volume's content.

[NOT YET: If srcVol and initialRoot are different, BRDisableSystemBootRoot()
 *      should be called on initialRoot so Boot!=Root won't later overwrite
 *      the files copied into the helper partition in question.]
[XX also need to make it an error if one of two safe modes aren't used:
 1) srcVol == initialRoot AND helperBSDName == only valid helper
    -> system Boot!=Root must (should?) be active
 2) srcVol != initialRoot OR helperBSDName != any default helper
    -> system Boot!=Root must be disabled]

 *
 *  @discussion
 *      Similar to BRCopyBootFiles(), BRCopyBootFilesToDir() copies
 *      appropriate boot cache files from a source OS volume to a
 *      directory in a helper partition.  Caches are updated if needed,
 *      possibly using the running system's kext infrastructure.
 *
 *      If targetDir is specified but does not exist, BRCopyBootFilesToDir()
 *      will create it only if (exactly) kBRBlessOnce is specified.
 *      In that case, it will be created within com.apple.boot.once,
 *      a directory which other libBootRoot calls (including
 *      Update(force=true) will clean up.
 *
 *      If targetDir does exist, BRCopyBootFilesToDir() will allow all
 *      bless options.  HOWEVER, BRCopyBootFilesToDir() will still rm -r
 *      and recreate it (mostly an implementation detail that simplifies
 *      error handling).  ANY OTHER CONTENT in an existing targetDir WILL
 *      BE DESTROYED.
 *
 *      To facilitate copying files to a directory that is not on a
 *      helper partition, specifying a target directory will skip
 *      unmounting targetBSDName.  If the copy leaves the default
 *      Boot!=Root files "up to date" for srcVol, then the "bootstamps"
 *      of srcVol will be updated (placating BRUpdateBootFiles()).
 *      targetDir cannot be "/".  It is recommended to either provide
 *      an existing directory or use a subsystem identifier
 *      (like com.apple.AppleNetInstall.caches).
 *      
 *      While BRCopyBootFiles() can copy boot files to any volume or
 *      directory, CoreStorage-based FDE only unlocks properly if the
 *      the target partition is an Apple_Boot following an
 *      Apple_CoreStorage.
 *
 *      BRCopyBootFilesToDir() requires a bless specification.  This
 *      blessSpec argument controls whether and how the target files
 *      will be "blessed" in the filesystem and/or pointed to directly
 *      or indirectly through efi-boot-* NVRAM variables.
